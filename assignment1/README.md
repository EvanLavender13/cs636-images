# CS636 - Advanced Rendering Techniques
## Assignment 1

## Configuration
All images use the following coordinate system:
- **X** left-right
- **Y** up-down
- **Z** in-out (of screen)

Camera configuration files are formatted as follows:
- **l** location vector
- **d** direction vector
- **u** up vector
- **a** viewing angle
- **h** horizontal resolution
- **v** vertical resolution

Scene configuration files are formatted as follows:
- **m** number of mesh models
  - followed by a model file path and location vector, for each model
- **p** number of parametric models (only spheres for now)
  - followed by a type, radius, and location vector, for each model

## Images

### Bunny
Recreation of the assignment example image (with a different orientation due to coordinate systems).
The first image shows `bound-bunny_1k.smf` and the second shows `bound-bunny_200.smf`.
